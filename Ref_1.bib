	abstract = {This volume is the third edition of the first-ever elementary book on the Langevin equation method for the solution of problems involving the translational and rotational Brownian motion of particles and spins in a potential highlighting modern applications in physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, and so on. In order to improve the presentation, to accommodate all the new developments, and to appeal to the specialized interests of the various communities involved, the book has been extensively rewritten and a very large amount of new material has been added. This has been done in order to present a comprehensive overview of the subject emphasizing via a synergetic approach that seemingly unrelated physical problems involving random noise may be described using virtually identical mathematical methods in the spirit of the founders of the subject, viz., Einstein, Langevin, Smoluchowski, Kramers, etc. The book has been written in such a way that all the material should be accessible both to an advanced researcher and a beginning graduate student. It draws together, in a coherent fashion, a variety of results which have hitherto been available only in the form of scattered research papers and review articles.Contents:Historical Background and Introductory ConceptsLangevin Equations and Methods of SolutionBrownian Motion of a Free Particle and a Harmonic OscillatorRotational Brownian Motion About a Fixed Axis in N-Fold Cosine PotentialsBrownian Motion in a Tilted Periodic Potential: Application to the Josephson Tunnelling JunctionTranslational Brownian Motion in a Double-Well PotentialNon-inertial Rotational Diffusion in Axially Symmetric External Potentials: Applications to Orientational Relaxation of Molecules in Fluids and Liquid CrystalsAnisotropic Non-inertial Rotational Diffusion in an External Potential: Application to Linear and Nonlinear Dielectric Relaxation and the Dynamic Kerr EffectBrownian Motion of Classical Spins: Application to Magnetization Relaxation in SuperparamagnetsInertial Effects in Rotational and Translational Brownian Motion for a Single Degree of FreedomInertial Effects in Rotational Diffusion in Space: Application to Orientational Relaxation in Molecular Liquids and FerrofluidsAnomalous Diffusion and RelaxationReadership: Advanced undergraduates, postgraduates, academics and researchers in statistical physics, condensed matter physics and magnetism, chemical physics, theoretical chemistry and applied mathematics.Keywords:Brownian Motion;Historical Development;Analogy with Financial Systems;Translational and Rotational Diffusion;Stochastic Differential Equations;Langevin Equation;FokkerâPlanck Equation;Characteristic Times of Relaxation Processes;Escape Rate Theory;Kramers Turnover Problem;Matrix Continued Fraction Solution of Evolution Equtions;Kerr Effect;Microwave (Debye) and Far-Infrared (Poley) Absorption;Dielectric Relaxation in Liquids and Nematic Liquid Crystals;Classical Spins;Superparamagnetism;NÃ©el-Brown Model;Dynamic Magnetic Hysteresis;Switching Fields;Stoner-Wohlfarth Astroids;Ferromagnetic Resonance;Ferrofluids;Josephson Effect;Ring Laser;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Stochastic Resonance;Anomalous Diffusion;Continuous Time Random Walk;Fractional Langevin Equation;Fractional FokkerâPlanck EquationKey Features:This volume is the third edition of the first elementary book on the Langevin equation method for the solution of problems involving the translational and rotational Brownian motion in a potential with particular emphasis on modern applications in the natural sciences, electrical engineering, etc.It has been extensively enlarged to cover in a reasonably succinct manner using a synergetic approach a number of new topics such as anomalous diffusion, continuous time random walks, stochastic resonance, superparamagnetism, magnetic resonance imaging, etc. which are of major current interest in view of the large number of disparate systems which exhibit these phenomenaThe book is written in a manner such that all the material should be accessible to an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate studentReviews:“This book is devoted to a detailed presentation of Langevin\&\#39;s idea and does this almost perfectly.

  abstract = {Earthquakes and the faults upon which they occur interact over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. In addition, many aspects of regional seismicity appear to be stochastic both in space and time. However, within this complexity, there is considerable self-organization. We argue that the occurrence of earthquakes is a problem that can be attacked using the fundamentals of statistical physics. Concepts of statistical physics associated with phase changes and critical points have been successfully applied to a variety of cellular automata models. Examples include sandpile models, forest fire models, and, particularly, slider block models. These models exhibit avalanche behavior very similar to observed seismicity. A fundamental question is whether variations in seismicity can be used to successfully forecast the occurrence of earthquakes. Several attempts have been made to utilize precursory seismic activation and quiescence to make earthquake forecasts, some of which show promise.},

The evaporation residue cross section, the fission cross section, the pre-scission neutron, proton and alpha multiplicities and the anisotropy of fission fragments angular distribution have been calculated for the excited compound nuclei 207At and 216Ra. In the modified statistical model the effects of spin K about the symmetry axis and temperature have been considered in calculations of the fission widths and the potential energy surfaces. It was shown that the modified statistical model can reproduce the above mentioned experimental data by using appropriate values of the temperature coefficient of the effective potential equal to λ=0.0180±0.0055, 0.0080±0.0030 MeV−2 and the scaling factor of the fission barrier height equal to rs=1.0015±0.0025, 1.0040±0.0020 for the compound nuclei 207At and 216Ra, respectively. Three collective shape coordinates plus the projection of total spin of the compound nucleus on the symmetry axis, K, were considered in the four dimensional dynamical model. In the dynamical calculations, dissipation was generated through the chaos weighted wall and window friction formula. Comparison of the theoretical results with the experimental data showed that two models make it possible to reproduce satisfactorily the above mentioned experimental data for the excited compound nuclei 207At and 216Ra.},

The friction state variable is discussed, including its interpretation as a measure of average asperity contact time and porosity within granular fault gouge. Data are summarized showing that friction evolves even during truly stationary contact, and the connection between modern friction laws and the concept of “static” friction is discussed. Measurements of frictional healing, as evidenced by increasing static friction during quasistationary contact, are reviewed, as are their implications for fault healing. Shear localization in fault gouge is discussed, and the relationship between microstructures and friction is reviewed. These data indicate differences in the behavior of bare rock surfaces as compared to shear within granular fault gouge that can be attributed to dilation within fault gouge. Physical models for the characteristic friction distance are discussed and related to the problem of scaling this parameter to seismic faults. Earthquake afterslip, its relation to laboratory friction data, and the inverse correlation between afterslip and shallow coseismic slip are discussed in the context of a model for afterslip. Recent observations of the absence of afterslip are predicted by the model.},

  abstract = {An earthquake fault pattern is assumed to consist of a system of infinitesimal, elementary dislocation loops. After an initial dislocation, subsequent ruptures occur according to a critical branching process. The position of each secondary dislocation loop is randomly shifted, along the initial fault-plane, from the location of the main shock. In addition, the orientations of the fault-plane and slip vector of the secondary dislocations are rotated according to a three-dimensional Cauchy distribution which has one intrinsic scaling parameter. In their turn, the secondary dislocations produce new dependent shocks according to the same law; the process cascades indefinitely. We simulate an earthquake fault system by the Monte Carlo method. This fault pattern is both visually and statistically similar to real earthquake faults. The model yields statistical spatial distributions that correspond to those of the analysis of the catalogue data of real earthquakes. We incorporate in our scheme the time-magnitude model of earthquake occurrence developed earlier. By the Monte Carlo method we then simulate synthetic sequences that reproduce all known magnitude-space-time statistical properties of real earthquake catalogues. The results of these simulations make us question the suitability of some terms that are commonly used in the theory of an earthquake source. For example, as a consequence of the validity of the stochastic model, the concepts like ‘an individual earthquake’, ‘fault-plane’ or ‘fault-surface’, ‘crack-tip’ or ‘fault-tip’, and ‘friction’, do not have an unambiguous definition.},

The method, which directly measures the increase in total fault length with a decrease in ruler size, gives the fractal dimension D and scaling properties for the chosen length band 0.5–1000 km. A physical interpretation of D is that it measures the irregularity of the fault trace in the selected band. The fault is subdivided into six segments of distinctive seismic behavior. A “main” fault trace which shows either maximum coseismic slip or creeping was selected for analysis, with three alternative branches examined for the SAF system south of San Bernardino. Branches of the fault trace are not considered in this work. Fractal dimensions calculated for the different segments range from 1.0008 to 1.0191, and are different from 1.0 to the 95\% confidence interval. These small changes reflect the overall smoothness of the main fault trace. Significant variations in D among segments indicate heterogeneities in the fault smoothness along strike. D also changes significantly from the short-length band to the long-length band where the demarcation point ranges from 1 to 2 km. The short-length band has larger D values. A slight correlation is obtained between the fractal dimension of the main trace and the extent of subparallel faulting. This indicates some correspondence between the main fault trace irregularity and the complexity of subsidiary fault traces in plan view.},

Four of them in 1967, 1973, 1980 and 1993, were potentially very destructive with magnitudes exceeding 5.0. The majority of seismic events recorded to date has been induced from Koyna-Warna reservoir areas. This paper discusses the fractal analysis of a fault map from LANDSAT images with the increasing seismic activity in the region. The region is divided into six blocks and the fractal dimension of each block is calculated using a box-counting technique. A plot of a three-dimensional map of the fractal dimension is prepared. It shows that the value of the fractal dimension is gently dipping from NE to SW. The fractal dimension is used to estimate the b-value in the frequency-magnitude relation of earthquakes in the region which is in agreement with earlier studies.},

  abstract   = {Based on fault maps, whether or not the fracture geometry of rocks is self-similar, was examined by using a box-counting algorithm. The statistical self-similarity (fractal structure) of the fault fracture systems holds well at the scale of about 2 to 20 km. The fractal dimension in Japan varied from 1.05 to 1.60. The fractal dimension is about 1.5–1.6 at the central part of the Japan Arc, and decreases with distance from the center. At a smaller scale, the fractal structure also holds well in the rock fracture geometry. The fractal dimension of the North Izu Peninsula fault system (branching faults) is 1.49 at the scale of 0.625 to 10 km, the fractal dimension of rock fracture geometry at the scale order of 10−1 to 10−2 meters is about 1.49–1.61. The upper limit of the fractal dimension of rock fracture geometry is about 1.6, judging from the estimation of fractal dimension on actual fracture geometry of rocks. This value may impose a restraint on modeling of faulting and the fracture process of rocks.},

  abstract = {Fractal measurements using the Cantor's dust method in a linear one-dimensional analysis mode were made on the fracture patterns revealed on two-dimensional, planar surfaces in four granites. This method allows one to conclude that:(1){\textbar}The fracture systems seen on two-dimensional surfaces in granites are consistent with the part of fractal theory that predicts a repetition of patterns on different scales of observation, self similarity. Fractal analysis gives essentially the same values of D on the scale of kilometres, metres and centimetres (five orders of magnitude) using mapped, surface fracture patterns in a Sierra Nevada granite batholith (Mt. Abbot quadrangle, Calif.).(2){\textbar}Fractures show the same fractal values at different depths in a given batholith. Mapped fractures (main stage ore veins) at three mining levels (over a 700 m depth interval) of the Boulder batholith, Butte, Mont. show the same fractal values although the fracture disposition appears to be different at different levels.(3){\textbar}Different sets of fracture planes in a granite batholith, Central France, and in experimental deformation can have different fractal values. In these examples shear and tension modes have the same fractal values while compressional fractures follow a different fractal mode of failure. The composite fracture patterns are also fractal but with a different, median, fractal value compared to the individual values for the fracture plane sets. These observations indicate that the fractal method can possibly be used to distinguish fractures of different origins in a complex system. It is concluded that granites fracture in a fractal manner which can be followed at many scales. It appears that fracture planes of different origins can be characterized using linear fractal analysis.},

Tribology, from the greek for study of rubbing, is the discipline that concerns itself with friction, wear and lubrication. Tribology spans a great range of disciplines, from surface physics to lubrication chemistry and engineering, and comprises investigators in diverse specialities. The English language tribology literature now grows at a rate of some 700 articles per year. But for all of this activity, in the three years that I have been concerned with the control of machines with friction, I have but once met a fellow controls engineer who was aware that the field existed, this including many who were concerned with friction. In this vein I must confess that, before undertaking these investigations, I too was unaware that an active discipline of friction existed. The experience stands out as a mark of the specialization of our time. Within tribology, experimental and theoretical understanding of friction in lubricated machines is well developed. The controls engineer's interest is in dynamics, which is not the central interest of the tribologist. The tribologist is more often concerned with wear, with respect to which there has been enormous progress - witness the many mechanisms which we buy today that are lubricated once only, and that at the factory. Though a secondary interest, frictional dynamics are note forgotten by tribology.},

The steady-state solution of the derived Langevin equation analytically attains the truncated exponential (TEX) distribution that is empirically characterized in many rupture models of earthquake events worldwide, as demonstrated by Thingbaijam and Mai (2016, https://doi.org/10.1785/0120150291). Our proposed stochastic dynamic faulting model for earthquake rupture intrinsically includes fluctuations and uncertainties in the heterogeneity of faulting planes as random variables. Specifically, we relate the characteristic parameter uc in TEX functions to the ratio of the diffusion and friction coefficients D and \{{\textbackslash}gamma\} of the Langevin equation.},

The idea of a frequency curve, for example, evidently implies an infinite hypothetical population distributed in a definite manner; but equally evidently the idea of an infinite hypothetical population requires a more precise logical specification than is contained in that phrase. The same may be said of the intimately connected idea of random sampling. These ideas have grown up in the minds of practical statisticians and lie at the basis especially of recent work; there can be no question of their pragmatic value. It was no part of my original intention to deal with the logical bases of these ideas, but some comments which Dr Burnside has kindly made have convinced me that it may be desirable to set out for criticism the manner in which I believe the logical foundations of these ideas may be established.},

  abstract = {Consider an isolated statistical system specified by a coordinate x and its probability density p(x). A functional of p(x) called ‘‘Fisher information’’ can be used to measure the degree of disorder of the system due to the spread in p(x). Fisher information may be minimized, subject to a physical constraint, to attain a temporal equilibrium solution p(x). When the constraint is linear in the mean kinetic energy of the system, the equilibrium solution p(x) often obeys the correct differential equation for the system. In this way, the Schrödinger (energy) wave equation, Klein-Gordon equation, Helmholtz wave equation, diffusion equation, Boltzmann law, and Maxwell-Boltzmann law may be derived from one classical principle of disorder. The convergence rate for Fisher information is about that for alternative use of maximum entropy (in problems where both have the same equilibrium solution). This suggests that Fisher information defines an arrow of time. The arrow points in the direction of decreasing accuracy for the determination of the mean, or ideal, value of a parameter.},

The data were recorded by the Sodar Rass system, which measures the speed and the direction of the wind at several heights above the ground level. To investigate the wind speed time series at seven heights above the ground level we used two different approaches: (i) multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), which permits the detection of multifractality in nonstationary series, and (ii) the Fisher–Shannon (FS) information plane, which allows the discrimination of dynamical features in complex time series. Our results point to the existence of multifractal time fluctuations in wind speed and to a dependence of the results on the height of the wind sensor. Even in the FS information plane a height-dependent pattern is revealed, indicating a good agreement with the multifractality. The obtained results could contribute to a better understanding of the complex dynamics of wind phenomena.},

Specifically, we derive an expression for Fisher Information based on sampling of the system trajectory as it evolves in the space defined by the state variables of the system, i.e. its state space. The Fisher Information index, as we have derived it, is a measure of system order, and captures the characteristic variation in speed and acceleration along the system's periodic steady-state trajectories. When calculated repeatedly over the system period, this index tracks steady states and transient behavior. We believe that such an index could be useful in detecting system 'flips' associated with a regime change, i.e. determining when systems are in a transient between one steady state and another. We illustrate the concepts using model ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The paper discusses the concept of entropy as applied to friction and wear. Friction and wear are classical examples of irreversible dissipative processes, and it is widely recognized that entropy generation is their important quantitative measure. On the other hand, the use of thermodynamic methods in tribology remains controversial and questions about the practical usefulness of these methods are often asked. A significant part of entropic tribological research was conducted in Russia since the 1970s. Surprisingly, many of these studies are not available in English and still not well known in the West. The paper reviews various views on the role of entropy and self-organization in tribology and it discusses modern approaches to wear and friction, which use the thermodynamic entropic method as well as the application of the mathematical concept of entropy to the dynamic friction effects (e.g., the running-in transient process, stick-slip motion, etc.) and a possible connection between the thermodynamic and information approach. The paper also discusses non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach to friction, wear, and self-healing. In general, the objective of this paper is to answer the frequently asked question “is there any practical application of the thermodynamics in the study of friction and wear?” and to show that the thermodynamic methods have potential for both fundamental study of friction and wear and for the development of new (e.g., self-lubricating) materials.},

Given an earthquake location determined by the P-wave arrival times at stations close to the epicenter, this relationship can be used to define a so-called “Pd magnitude” of earthquakes. Our result shows that for earthquakes in southern California the Pd magnitudes agree with the catalog magnitudes with a standard deviation of 0.18 for events less than magnitude 6.5. Therefore, Pd is a robust measurement for estimating the magnitudes of earthquakes and has practical application in earthquake early warning systems.},

  abstract   = {We examine the initial subevent (ISE) of the M 6.7, 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake in order to discriminate between two end-member rupture initiation models: the ‘preslip’ and ‘cascade’ models. Final earthquake size may be predictable from an ISE's seismic signature in the preslip model but not in the cascade model. In the cascade model ISEs are simply small earthquakes that can be described as purely dynamic ruptures. In this model a large earthquake is triggered by smaller earthquakes; there is no size scaling between triggering and triggered events and a variety of stress transfer mechanisms are possible. Alternatively, in the preslip model, a large earthquake nucleates as an aseismically slipping patch in which the patch dimension grows and scales with the earthquake's ultimate size; the byproduct of this loading process is the ISE. In this model, the duration of the ISE signal scales with the ultimate size of the earthquake, suggesting that nucleation and earthquake size are determined by a more predictable, measurable, and organized process. To distinguish between these two end-member models we use short period seismograms recorded by the Southern California Seismic Network. We address questions regarding the similarity in hypocenter locations and focal mechanisms of the ISE and the mainshock. We also compare the ISE's waveform characteristics to those of small earthquakes and to the beginnings of earthquakes with a range of magnitudes. We find that the focal mechanisms of the ISE and mainshock are indistinguishable, and both events may have nucleated on and ruptured the same fault plane. These results satisfy the requirements for both models and thus do not discriminate between them. However, further tests show the ISE's waveform characteristics are similar to those of typical small earthquakes in the vicinity and more importantly, do not scale with the mainshock magnitude. These results are more consistent with the cascade model.},

Deconvolution of instrument and path effects by empirical Green's functions demonstrates that the initial complexity at the start of the earthquake is a source effect.

	abstract = {The heat flow paradox provides evidence that a dynamic weakening mechanism may be important in understanding fault friction and rupture. We present here a specific model for dynamic velocity weakening that uses the mechanics of well-studied industrial bearings to explain fault zone processes. An elevated fluid pressure is generated in a thin film of viscous fluid that is sheared between nearly parallel surface. This lubrication pressure supports part of the load, therefore reducing the normal stress and associated friction across the gap. The pressure also elastically deforms the wall rock. The model is parameterized using the Sommerfeld number, which is a measure of the lubrication pressure normalized by the lithostatic load. For typical values of the material properties, slip distance and velocity, the Sommerfeld number suggests that lubrication is an important process. If the lubrication length scales as the slip distance in an earthquake, the frictional stress during dynamically lubricated large earthquakes is 30\% less than the friction with only hydrostatic pore pressure. Elastohydrodynamic lubrication also predicts a decrease in high-frequency ({\textgreater}1 Hz) radiation above a critical slip distance of a few meters. This prediction is well matched by the strong motion data from the 1999 Taiwan earthquake. The observed 2 orders of magnitude variation in scaled radiated energy between small (Mw {\textless} 4) and large earthquakes (Mw {\textgreater} 6) is also predicted by the lubrication model.},

  abstract = {Although many contacts operate under unsteady loading and sliding conditions, friction behavior under such conditions is still not well understood. In this paper we report on a series of experiments that were run to examine friction-velocity characteristics of line contacts operating under unsteady sliding velocities in the mixed, elastohydrodynamic and hydrodynamic lubrication regimes. A periodic, time-varying velocity component was superimposed on a steady sliding speed in such a way that all three lubrication regimes could be covered in a cycle. It was found that as the frequency of oscillation was increased, a multi-valued friction coefficient appeared as a loop about the average (steady state) friction-velocity relation. It is shown that this behavior can be modeled by a characteristic time lag between a changing velocity and the corresponding steady state friction. The latter is described by a single equation that was matched to measured average friction data. In the mixed lubrication regime, which is where this lag most significantly affects friction behavior, the lag time increases with normal load and lubricant viscosity. It is shown that the time shift is not associated with a fixed characteristic distance. The observed delay arises due to entrainment and normal approach, which includes squeeze-films combined with rough surface contact deformations.},

The rupture modeling is carried out using a three-dimensional finite-difference method, and the inversion is implemented by a neighbourhood algorithm, minimizing the misfit between computed and observed near-fault seismograms. We test the method by estimating the stress drop within 32 regions on the causative fault for the 2000 magnitude 6.6 Western Tottori, Japan, earthquake. While the dynamic models show both similarities and differences with the conventional kinematic models, our method provides an ensemble of physically-correct models with plausible rupture propagation for the earthquake.},

The dynamic rupture reproduces the general slip pattern used to compute the initial stress distribution and generates near-fault ground motions at the surface similar to observations. The simulated rupture propagates on the fault along a complex path with highly variable speed and rise time, changing the magnitude and pattern of the stress significantly.

  abstract = {SUMMARY Due to uncertainties in data and in forward modelling, the inherent limitations in data coverage and the non-linearity of the governing equation, earthquake source imaging is a problem with multiple solutions. The multiplicity of solutions can be conveniently expressed using a Bayesian approach, which allow to state inferences on model parameters in terms of probability density functions. The estimation of the posterior state of information, expressing the combination of the a priori knowledge on model parameters with the information contained in the data, is achieved in two steps. First, we explore the model space using an evolutionary algorithm to identify good data fitting regions. Secondly, using a neighbourhood algorithm and considering the entire ensemble of models found during the search stage, we compute a geometric approximation of the true posterior that is used to generate a second ensemble of models from which Bayesian inference can be performed. We apply this methodology to infer kinematic parameters of a synthetic fault rupture through fitting of strong motion data. We show how multiple rupture models are able to reproduce the observed waveforms within the same level of fit, suggesting therefore that the solution of the inversion cannot be expressed in terms of a single model but rather as a set of models which show certain statistical properties. For all model parameters we compute the posterior marginal distribution. We show how for some parameters the posterior do not follow a Gaussian distribution rendering the usual characterization in terms of mean value and standard deviation not correct. We compare the posterior marginal distributions with the ?raw? marginal distributions computed from the ensemble of models generated by the evolutionary algorithm. We show how they are systematically different proving therefore that the search algorithm we adopt cannot be directly used to estimate uncertainties. We also analyse the stability of our inferences comparing the posterior marginals computed by different independent ensembles. The solutions provided by independent explorations are similar but not identical because each ensemble searches the model space differently resulting in different reconstructed posteriors. Our study illustrates how uncertainty estimates derive from the topology of the objective function, and how accurate and reliable resolution analysis is limited by the intrinsic difficulty of mapping the ?true? structure of the objective function.},
